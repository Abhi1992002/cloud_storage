### Could I use AWS S3?

- First question is Why didn't i use S3, the reason is simple that i have used s3 bucket in my past projects and i want to use edgestore, that's it.
- If i want to create it using AWS S3, I could make it easily, How?
- Take multiple files from the user using react dropZone.
- Then upload all these files using S3 client.
  ```js
  var s3 = new AWS.S3({apiVersion: '2006-03-01', region: 'us-west-2'});
  var params = {
    Bucket: 'bucket',
    Key: 'example2.txt',
    Body: 'Uploaded text using the promise-based method!'
  };
  var putObjectPromise = s3.putObject(params).promise();
  ```
- Uploading all files one by one might took lot of it so we could use `Promsie.all()` or some external library like `p concurrency` to upload multiple files
  ```js
  var putAllObject = Promise.all(promsie1 , promise2 , promise3)
  ```
- Add file url in database
